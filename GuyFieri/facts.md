At the age of 10, I built a bicycle-powered pretzel cart with my dad. We called “The Awesome Pretzel.”

I once had a second job as a dishwasher, which helped me earn enough money to study abroad in Chantilly, France.

When I was 10 years old, I was thrown from a horse then subsequently trampled by it. I suffered significant damage to my liver and a bruised heart. My parents were backpacking in Europe at the time, so an attorney had to sign a court order allowing for emergency surgery. Now I have a large scar on my stomach as a result of that incident.

Did you know I make a “bomb-ass” Pinot (made from grapes grown at My own vineyard), a Zinfandel, and a Bordeaux blend?

Contrary to popular belief, I will not eat all parts of an Animal. My eating Philosophy: “You can live super healthy and get hit by a truck and others eat the pork rinds, drink, and live to 100. So I eat, but I do not appreciate the parts of the animal that had a job. Parts that are licked, make sound, push, filter, walk, and so on are not for me.”

I'm a big fan of Vanity Plates

The New York Times once reviewed me with ZERO-STARS in 2012... I didn't even know that was possible.

I have a pet sulcata tortoise named Pop. He lives in a pen in my backyard.

I used to work in Carnival Cruise line's Kitchen.

So you want to know the story of Donkey Sauce? When I was younger, I was working on a Carnival Cruise in the kitchen. I explained to one of the other chefs that you have to put the sauce on the burgers. He has this really thick accent and asks, ‘Why?’ ‘You have to put the sauce on the burger or you’re a jackass.’ And he goes, ‘Jackass? What’s a jackass?’ ‘It’s a donkey.’ ‘Oh, so it’s donkey sauce.’ That’s really how it happened.

Did you know: Melissa McCarthy's Bridesmaids character is based on me?
